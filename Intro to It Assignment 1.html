            Hey all 

            My name is Jacob i am 23 years of age from the central coast. 
            
            I always had a passion for computers and such from a young age whether it’s gaming, making videos making music and playing a sports 
            
            I started my career first as a carpenter finished that apprenticeship in 2017 now it’s time to move onto something else, from a young age About 15 I started a forum site about skating as that interested me, and a few other little niches. I guess you could say I’m trying to broaden my choices I have a little bit of experience in building websites to an extent I’m not professional I just have minimal knowledge from when I was younger doing allot of things online keen to start the next project once I get more knowledge of the course be able to do so many more things like make a few apps 
            
            and now I think it’s time to persue a bachelor of information technology </p>
